## cover usage of dyno notes: 

- adding and removing notes (explain the bug with a new line not working)

- accessing notes

- muting and banning


## cover how to turn on developer mode and how to get IDs

## notes should have: 

- reason for the noting
- if a person has been threaded, the link to the thread (this could possibly be moved to zaps once we start using them)
- notes should be used in #chat-mod-actions

## cover how to create private threads:

- should be covered for both mobile and desktop
- if a person is private threaded, there should be a note made on them (this could possibly be moved to zaps once we start using them)
- moderation should be done primarily in private threads, not publicly
- users should be addressed via private threads, giving the explanation is beneficial for future cases (study: https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1457918177946570754?s=21)

## explain how to use zaps appropriatlely, especially: 

- zaps should be used in #chat-mod-actions
- explaining the zap system, just so we can have the explanation in the guidelines
- there should be multiple real(? questionable, consult with the team first) examples of a user violating the rules, and the appropriate zap
- would be neat to connect the examples with the moderation matrix examples
- there should be examples where the user continues breaking the rules, so the team can have a demonstration how the zaps build upon eachother

## the guideline should also link to discords post on moderation:

- https://discord.com/moderation/4405230698519-110:-Moderator-Etiquette
- there should be research done on discords moderation seminars to decide if any of them would be a valuable addition to the moderation guidelines
